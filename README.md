## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create visualizations that provide insights for investors to support a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. From the given dataset, we were able to create visualizations to see trip duration, trop duration based on gender, peak usage, peak usage based on gender, usage based on user type (subscriber vs customer), a breakdown of user types, and a breakdown of user gender.

## Results
#### This graph shows that most riders are on a bike for 5 minutes. The vast majority of riders take trips between 1 minute and 25 minutes.

#### This graph shows that men are the primary user of these bikes - about 3x more than women at their respective peak usages. For both genders, most riders are on a bike for about 5 minutes.

#### This heat maps shows that the vast majority of activity happens Monday-Friday 6am to 9am and 5pm-8pm. Perhaps riders are using the bikes to commute to and from work? The weekends (Saturday and Sunday) are also very active between 9am-5pm.

#### This heat map shows that although men use the bikes much more than women, that both genders typically use the bikes during the same timeframe (Monday-Friday 6am to 9am and 5pm-8pm and Saturday and Sunday 9am-5pm).

#### This heat map shows that 'subscribers' use the bikes far more than 'customers'.

Female: 588,431
Unknown: 225,521

## Summary
Based off of the analysis, we can infer that many of these users may not be tourists but rather work commuters, as most of the peak times are around morning and evening commute. Additionally, a majority of the users were male riders. This may not be anything significant, but it's useful for future marketing campaings. Another significant point that can be made is that most of the ride durations peaked at around 5 minutes. If there were to be a bike-sharing program set up in Des Moines, it would help if each station can be set up within 10 minutes of biking distance from each other. This is because we need to take into account that NYC is a large city, where as Des Moines is mainly suburbs. Places tend to be farther apart in suburbs compared to places in large cities.
